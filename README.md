# goldmine
## Introduction
This project was created for CPSC 340, to focus on 2d arrays, input handing, and error handling.
The concept follows the logic of minesweeper, where there is an empty grid with 3 objects hidden 
in it. A gold object, coal, and rainbow. Finding each gives a special message and updates 
player stats.
